You live and learn
Except I don't feel like that
You live and you don't learn

I wonder what I could've did and what I never did
I wonder what you could've hid and what you could've said
It's not a lot of people like us, so I have respect
But don't go talking out ya neck unless you love being dead
I might go crazy, I'm out my head
I might kill 'em, and drop 'em dead
I might've did it, but I don't think I did
I might've done some things I never did
What would you do if everything was just not for you?
What would you do if every time you jumped, the hula hoop's on fire?
But tell me just don't lie
Well, tell me when you lie
Don't tell me when you cry
Just inform me when you die
I don't search for nothing I'm not one to go and pry
But I'm one to leave you backstabbed and leave ya blind
A cut across the eyes'll leave you blind for life
It only takes one time, it only takes a knife
I brought a big AR out, and you brought the knife
I'ma kill you nice and quick, that's kinda kind
And don't go waste my time
And don't go talking to me if you know you not gone be mine

I own a private jet
I'm on a power trip
You don't have to say what you did
I already know before you said
Pushing button's a instrument, so let me play
I ain't heard you, so speak up when you gone say it
Somebody getting saved tonight
Somebody getting played tonight
Got a very bad, but very good mind
A whole lot of things look worse in the light
And a whole lot get worse when you try
That's why I don't let a lot of things fly

If I could, then I would
I don't ever get stuck to a thing unless it's good
Is it good for me or bad for you or both of us?
And it's hard to believe you more than most of us
Riding 'round, a gun inside my pocket like I'm supposed to
They ain't ever gonna let you in, they ain't supposed to
Every time you walk a mile you only a inch closer
Keep on inching like a slug till it's over
Keep in mind that this s**t ain't gone be over
Keep in mind when you push me, push me over
I'm a G-Wagon, you a Range Rover
And it's hard for me to ever stay sober
I'ma sit down at the top until its over
Wait, wait, till it's over
Wait till it's over

Oh, moving
Oh, places with ya
I told myself, "Never again," but I did it again and I do it every time
Moving fast, moving slow, moving sideways at times
When I'm high, and I can't hide behind the lies
And I know that you know that you feel that
'Cause you couldn't look me in my motherf*ckin' eyes
What you mean when you talking to me?
All that we have's the future
You not on our f*cking level
And this new life now
It's a new life now
The plane just landed
For my trip
But I'm always on that trip

I don't even know my home phone, I don't even know my planet
Don't even know how I made this s**t, don't even know how I planned it
Used to be popping Percocet like s**t was f*ckin' candy

I just called up Space X and asked 'em, "Where my planet?"
I can't listen to what you said, I told you to f*ckin' can it
Divide is way too real, but now I understand it
Underestimated you, but now I understand it
I can't listen to no music, I can't f*cking stand it
Popped so many X pills, I don't know how I'm standing
When you live like me so much, and then you'll understand it

When you feel amazing, do you feel a mess?
I feel amazing, feel it in my chest
When I take a breath, no, I don't inhale
If you said all that s**t and you meant it
Don't take it back, don't take it back, don't take it
I seen a thousand things that I can't explain
But I did a thousand things that could push you away
And I know it's not for me 'cause I'm out of the way
When I live like this, you know that you never could stay
And I take it all too seriously, I never could play
But I lived a lot of life so I can't complain

Lived a lot of life and not a thing's changed
A lot of things change, people don't change
I just spent a quarter million on a f*ckin' chain
I just spent a quarter million on that f*ckin' plane
I just spent a half a million on a Cullinan
I just spent a quarter million on a butler, man
Yeah, covering my face like Jimmy Butler, man
Yeah, I got couple watches, couple watches move
We don't go band for band, we go bil for bil
We don't link 'n build, we make buildings build
Dystopian society on Silent Hill
I just wanna feel things, I wanna feel real
I want to feel like normal human, don't wanna pop a pill
I wash my hands of all this blood, and then I keep it real
Just tell me how you feeling
When you come inside this building, tell me how you feeling
I don't wanna hear your lies, I wanna hear how you feeling
How you really feeling, and how you really dealing
With all the stress, you say that occupy your mind, you krilling
I don't know nobody at all, I'm not even from this planet
I could take the first shuttle off, and I don't even know where I'm landing
I don't even know my home phone, I don't even know my planet
Don't even know how I made this s**t, don't even know how I planned it
Used to be popping Percocet like s**t was f*ckin' candy
I'm gone call up Elon Musk and ask him where we landing
I just called up Space X and asked 'em, "Where my planet?"
I can't listen to what you said, I told you to f*ckin' can it
Divide is way too real, but now I understand it
Underestimated you, but now I understand it
I can't listen to no music, I can't f*cking stand it
Popped so many X pills, I don't know how I'm standing
When you live like me so much, and then you'll understand it

If I may, could I ask if I should? (Woo)
On this life, you could never get enough (woo, woo)
On a pill, you could never feel numb (woo)

Doing things that you never should

I just went rogue, yeah, don't call up my phone
Don't text me 'bout s**t, yeah, I don't wanna know

I don't wanna hear if you live like me, then you lose control
I don't wanna hear if you in 2093, we all know
I don't wanna hear if you're near me, no, I won't hear your soul
Soul (let it go)

All you wanna see is diamonds

You don't know how inside of my mind gets
Shut your mouth, close your eyelids

Yeah, I'm sick and twisted, know my brain not right
It's on autopilot, let it fly all night
But don't let it go crazy, don't let it turn you to a lie
But don't get so damn crazy that it stab you with a knife
Lock in with all the voices, yeah, don't let 'em tell you lies
And you probably see a demon if you look me in the eyes

Look me in the eyes, you see my eyes bleedin'
Oh, that b***h give me head, that b***h give me brain

Small feet, but I kick a**es, call me and your b***h answer
I been on the job twenty-four seven, I keep the AK-four-seven
I'm cheese-head, but my whore yellow, I'm outside like Coachella
Her mouth dry, but her throat wetter, I fly by and leave no feathers
Rock a wife beater in cold weather, brown skin nigga, I'm a gold metal
All my watches on demon time, all these diamonds, I can't even see the time
Pockets, they be on dinner time, Thanksgiving time, November slime
Judge always tryna give me time, gave me fed time and that's plenty time
And I ain't got time like the end of time, I'll kill a nigga, like I'm killin' time
Uh, it's me and lil' Yeat, what's happenin'?
Sick and twisted evil bastards
Smoke a nigga, where the matches?
And let his mama have the ashes, Mula

All you wanna see is diamonds
All I wanna see is violence
You don't know how inside of my mind gets
Shut your mouth, close your eyelids

Don't you join a world that you can never live a life, yeah
Don't it feel amazing when you playing with the spite?
I know you feel crazy when you put it on your life
I know you getting lazy when you say you'd rather die

Pull up with the Martians and they know I'm 'bout to fly

All this money, it get trifling (trife, trife)
But I'm trifling, 'cause I'm on bad timing
But it's also perfect timing, 'cause I need to remind you

But don't tell me, "Go help yourself", you can go and die
Do what you want, I won't hold the gun (I won't hold a grudge)
But imagine me there, with a dead blank stare
I was tryna warn you, but it seem like you don't care
And it's fine, that's fair, yeah, I would never care
I don't need to see, yeah, I don't need to hear
I don't wanna talk to you, yeah, I don't want you near
I never would care, you said, "Life ain't fair"
It's fair enough to me, I'ma let you feel free (yeah)
And I do it better, so I know that you could fail (yeah)
I do it for me, I don't do it for you
And it's cool
Lotta baggage to unpack, and it's cool
I can't go back on my words 'cause that'd be rude
Yeah, I like being disrespectful and that's cool

We live in the dark, live on the moon
I guess two-zero-nine-three is not for you (you, you, you, you)

The only thing I need from you (from you)
Instead of tellin' me things
I wish you would feel like me (I wish you would feel like me)
I wish you could see like me (I wish you could see like me)
And there's more to life than that (and there's more to life than that)
And there's more to life than this (and there's more to life than this)
And I tell you that now (and I tell you that now)
Now I want you to feel (now I want you to feel)

Forever
Don't you feel good? You say you feel good
(Good) I'ma let you cry (good God)

You know this ship's tight
It's more than just me
It's more that you see

Pay more just to feel
Clinging on the sheets
Falling down for weeks
History repeats

Yeah, f**k off, f**k off

And I'm praying that you make one wrong move
It's no telling what I might or might not do
Heard you say you won't fold, you won't bend
Let's all get high as f**k and pretend
I'll be wrong 'til I die, 'til the end
If I ask you if you lied, you say, "Yeah"
You say, "Yeah"
How could I make it up to you?
I say, "You can't"
Just get the f**k away from me
And it's more than that, and it's more than this
I'm just tryna imagine all the times I pissed
I'm just tryna imagine why you'd do that s**t
But I couldn't imagine it (yeah)
And it's nowhere I'd rather be
On the beach with a tragedy
And she called me, "Your Majesty"
Making movies appear so magically
Yeah, and it's sad that you'd said what you wouldn't do
And it's sad to look back on what you wouldn't do
And it's sad, and it's sad
And it's sad, and it's sad (ah)
But I'm glad that you had your fun, you had your fun on it
But I'm bad for the things I say and the things I want on it
How you mad that I got this money that I never even asked for?
How you sad 'bout a slag, when you wasn't even up for it?

Wasn't up, wasn't up, wasn't up, wasn't up, wasn't up, wasn't up

I remember the times we used to have
I remember the nights we used to have
Even remember times when it was bad
Even remember times we never had (yeah)
I can see all between the lines that you said that you wouldn't do
And times that you said that you'd come, but you never do
I heard planes, yeah, they fly, yeah, they fly 'til they never do
And we crash and we burn, turn a page, or another two
We can go back and do things that we said that we'd never do (yeah)
I say, "On God," but I never knew
I like to fly, yeah, I like to fly a few
Yeah, I already died, I already tried a few
Yeah, don't be surprised (yeah), you know my life too

Did a lot of wrong inside my life but I don't have no regrets
I leveled up, I bought the Cayenne and bought the jet
I don't give no f*cks 'bout what you talking 'bout, I'm not impressed
And you still live at your mommy's house, I'd be depressed
You can't do s**t on your own, like I got to tell you to get dressed
You could choose to live like me and die or live like all the rest
I risked my life a million times for no accomplishments
I just wake up then get high, then get to popping s**t
You ain't risk nothing at all, you don't deserve to ball
You don't deserve pointers in the watch, you deserve to trip and fall
I can end the things that let you watch the world with one call
Couple exes, couple haters, know they waiting on me to fall
I'll take every last season, if I don't got legs, then I'ma crawl
